The primary use of isatty is in programming, especially when writing command-line tools\nor scripts that need to behave differently when interacting with a user in a terminal versus when\nprocessing data non-interactively. It helps determine whether features like interactive prompts,\ncolored output, or progress bars should be used based on the execution environment."""
