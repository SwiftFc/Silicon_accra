#Calculate the area of Rectangle

#Take two variables named 'length' and 'width'
#and assign them with '10' and '5' respectively
length = 10
width = 5

speed = 10
distance = 20

#now area is the product of 'length' and 'width'
area = length*width
acceleration = speed * distance
print("The area is:", area)
print("The acceleration is:", acceleration)
